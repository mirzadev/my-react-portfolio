*Being a Full Stack Web Developer means being part of a community. Developing a software from the scratch and handing over to the product owner a bug free software is not a easy job.

An employer will always feel comfortable with a developer who has the knowledge on latest technologies and variety in experience. This brings the necessety of a developer to keep own portfolio always updated so that he/she can present his / her qualifications to the prospective employer with full confidence.Preparing portfolio with React is going to be one of the best option for a developer to present himself with full confidence.*
