## Description

*Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. I as a Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases. But like most developers I also spend at least some of my time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. To help creating such technical post I felt the necessity of developing a Tech Blog where I can share my experiences with others and get the same back from other developers. With this aim, this "MVC Tech Blog" is created!*
